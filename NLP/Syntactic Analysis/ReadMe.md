Build a HMM based POS tagger using Viterbi Algorithm.
Other techniques like Lexicon rule based and Stochastic parsing are also used in the code for building a POS tagger and results compared.

Data used: The Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset is used. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.
